// EXERCISE
// In this exercise, we will split out a new Logo component from the App component. And then we'll add a new BestPokemon component:

// You should complete the following steps:

// In your pokedex React app, open the src/App.js file.
// Create a new function named Logo.
// Copy the <header> element and its contents and paste it into the Logo component.
// Replace the <header> element in the App component with the new Logo component.
// Create a new component function named BestPokemon and return a <p> element with some text saying which is your favorite Pokemon (e.g. "My favorite Pokemon is Squirtle").
// Render your new BestPokemon component below the Logo component within the App component.
